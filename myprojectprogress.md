# Write about your thoughts on possible projects of interest and how you would like to organize it. Common repository? Blessed repository? Other?
    A project that I interested in is YACS.N. I would organized the front-end , back-end, and API into different repository. So that jobs of each part of the project is separted and clear. Also, in each repository, I will create various folders for more specific feature for YACS.N, such as pathway feature folder, subject search feature folder. Furthermore, I will create different branch for the other student teams who are working on the project, so that it will not affect the master branch, if something goes wrong.
